									<p>Imagine you're in a line waiting for your turn to go through the grocery store checkout and you suddenly see someone who is very upset. Their voice is raised, you can tell by the hand gestures that they are really angry and they storm out of the doors of the store. In this scenario, did you imagine that this person walked in a specific way as they stormed off the store? </p>

									<p> What I'm trying to getting at is this -- our emotions are interconnected with our movements, and that walking (gait) can possibly be an implicit indicator of emotional state. In movies, television, animation, theatre etc. the movements of a person has always been used to imply their emotions. You never see actors that hop and skip across the stage in a happy upbeat tone when reciting Hamlet's famous "To be or not to be" soliloquy where the main character contemplates suicide.</p>

									<p>So, then that bring us to the question, how DOES emotions change our walking?</p>
<br>
									<p>This was the main question that I aimed to answer in my MSc work. You can read the actual paper <a href ="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0284308">here</a>. But in general, the emotions of sadness and excitement played the largest role in changing the way we walk. Excitement tends to increase the speed and pace of our walk, we spend less time on the ground and with less foot contact time when excited. Sadness on the other hand had opposite effects, walking was slower and we not only spent more time on the ground while sad but we also spent more time with both our feet planted while sad. Although posture was not assessed, it is shown by other researchers that our posture is also affected by emotion. We're more hunched over, with drooping necks and less overall movement while sad but the opposite is true when we're happy. </p>

									<br>
									<h2> So what is the point of this research? </h2>
									<p> Gait, is the pattern of how we walk. Physical and neurological diseases impact the way we walk and the assessment of our walking is a large determinant of disease progression, independence/autonomy and overall health. If emotions have the capacity to change the way we walk then it implicates our gait analysis everytime we measure it. How can we be sure that a decrease in walking pace today was caused by some disease or medical intervention but not a change in emotional state? Essentially emotions may act as confounds to current clinical gait analysis and thus identifying how emotions change walking can help us better identify and be specific about how to better measure gait and the effects of medical intervention and rehabilitation. <br> <br>  
									
									Understanding the mechanisms and nuances of emotion and gait also can help us understand how movement is processed in the brain. Neurological diseases can impact emotion and emotional moods, does that mean their gait is also implicated? Patients with clinical depression show marked changes in their gait but they're similar to the change in gait seen in participants who were sad. How are these two related and how far can we draw the conlusions between everyday "sadness" and clinical depression?  </p>
