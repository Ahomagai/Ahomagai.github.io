  ownership, political party affiliation, link to hate groups etc. affected the deadliness of a mass  
  shooting incident  

- [**Emergency room readmission: Prediction of high-frequency users of emergency departments using  
MIMICIII dataset & various machine learning models (SQL & Python)**](https://github.com/Ahomagai/HighFrequencyEmergencyDepartmentML)
