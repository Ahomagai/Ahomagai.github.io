## Projects

- **Deadliness in mass shootings: What factors determine deadliness of a mass shooting incident in  
the United States? (R)**  

  - Used data from the Violence Project to determine whether factors such as gun law strictness, gun  
  ownership, political party affiliation, link to hate groups etc. affected the deadliness of a mass  
  shooting incident  

- **Emergency room readmission: Prediction of high-frequency users of emergency departments using  
MIMICIII dataset & various machine learning models (PostgreSQL & Python)**  

  - Compared and optimized various ML models (XGBoost, Ensemble, SVM etc.) to identify the best  performing model that predicted high frequency users of emergency departments  

- **Three parties of Ontario: Insights into 2018 and 2022 provincial elections (Tableau & Python)**  

  - Compared Ontario provincial election results and highlighted insights from the 2018 and 2022  
  results across the three major parties, creating interactive geospatial maps of riding outcomes  

- **Wrangling Chess: Analyzing first move advantage and most common first move in chess (R)**  

  - Used R and Lichess.com to extract and wrangle unstructured text into usable tabular data and  
  performed linear regressions to calculate first move ELO advantage and most common move
